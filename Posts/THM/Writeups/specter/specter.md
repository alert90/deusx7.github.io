Welcome to **Specter**! This machine is crafted to push your hacking skills to the limit. Your challenge is to uncover hidden vulnerabilities, exploit them, and ultimately gain root access to capture the flag. Please start the machine and give it 5 minutes to fully boot up. Dive in, think creatively, and get to root. Good luck!

```

```shell
nmap -sCV -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 IP -oN scan -vv
```

3 ports are open
- FTP File Transfer Protocol (21)
- SSH Secure Shell (22)
- HTTP Hypertext Transfer Protocol (80)

# What is the hidden directory?

Since HTTP is running on port 80 it means there is a website there.

Copy and paste the IP into the URL bar 

![](attachments/20240530133547.png)

To find hidden directories, we can perform a directory scan, You can use any tool but i'll be using `dirsearch` with it's default wordlist

![](attachments/20240530133743.png)

```shell
sudo dirsearch -u URL
```

![](attachments/20240530133923.png)

We are able to find a robots.txt file. 

What is robots.txt file?

A robots.txt file **tells search engine crawlers which URLs the crawler can access on your site**.

Checking out the contents of this file in our web browser we can see a disallowed directory and this is our hidden directory

# Who is the user with weak credentials?

Taking a step back, before visiting this webpage. Looking back at the nmap scan it show that we have anonymous login enabled for the FTP server. This means we can login with the username `anonymous` and no password

![](attachments/20240530134515.png)

Login to the ftp server and download all files using the command `mget *`

![](attachments/20240530134644.png)

Checking the contents of the files

![](attachments/20240530134755.png)

We have an incomplete username and the message says the password for the user was easily crackable. This means if we are able to get the full username, we can perform a brute force attack on the SSH service running on the machine and gain access.

Going back to the webpage we found `/page004555456.php`

Visiting the webpage shows there is an LFI (Local File Inclusion) vulnerability present in the URL

![](attachments/20240530135012.png)

This vulnerability will basically allow us to read file on the server by specifying the path to the file.

The view parameter is the vulnerable parameter so let's say we want to check the file that contains list of users on a linux system (/etc/passwd) which is accessible to every user, we can do so by just supplying the path to the view parameter

![](attachments/20240530135248.png)

We can see 2 users `alex` and `sophia`

Remember the message from earlier the user's name started with an S which means the user is `sophia`. So this answers the question.

# What is the user's password?

Time to brute force SSH using hydra for sophia's password

![](attachments/20240530141104.png)

```shell
hydra -l sophia -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ssh://IP -t4 -V
```

After a couple minutes, we get the password

![](attachments/20240530141032.png)

Next step is to ssh into the machine

![](attachments/20240530141219.png)

# What is the user flag? 

Next up is to find the flag, we can see the flag is in alex's home directory

![](attachments/20240530141433.png)

![](attachments/20240530141544.png)

But we can see only alex can read the file, which means we have to pivot to alex.

Checking commands our user can run with sudo

![](attachments/20240530141641.png)

we can't run anything.

To make things easier, we can use a script called [linpeas](https://linpeas.sh/) to automate the lateral privilege escalation enumeration

- Download the script
- Start a python server on your machine
- use wget to download the script to the target machine
- give the script executable permission
- run the script

![](attachments/20240530143650.png)

Checking through the results, you can see a directory

![](attachments/20240530143950.png)

I somehow missed this initially, there is an actual directory with the name `...` in alex's home direcotory

![](attachments/20240530144048.png)

inside here we can find the password for alex

![](attachments/20240530144120.png)

Switch to the alex user using the `su` command and obtain the flag

![](attachments/20240530144221.png)

# What is the root flag?

Checking for sudo permissions as the user alex we can see the user alex can run the curl command without a password

![](attachments/20240530144315.png)

One easy way to exploit this is to just read the flag directly

![](attachments/20240530150003.png)

```shell
sudo /usr/bin/curl "file:///root/root.txt"
```
