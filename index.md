### Welcome To My Cyber Security Blog, <span style="font-family: monospace;">D3u$-X</span>
* * *

Hello, :wave: I have a deep passion for cybersecurity, and I'm on a journey to become a skilled pentester and ethical hacker. My fascination with the world of hacking and digital security has driven me to constantly explore and learn new concepts.

One of my favorite pastimes is playing Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges on platforms like TryHackMe and Hack The Box. These challenges provide the perfect opportunity to put my skills to the test, solve complex puzzles, and uncover vulnerabilities in a controlled environment.

As I progress on this cybersecurity journey, I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences with others. You'll often find me writing detailed write-ups and walkthroughs for various CTFs. These write-ups not only help me solidify my understanding but also serve as a valuable resource for the cybersecurity community.

This GitHub repository is my digital playground, where I showcase my projects, contributions, and the tools I've developed along the way. Feel free to explore my work, and if you share my passion for cybersecurity, let's connect and collaborate!
